# GGPlot    
This script will go over a lot of the basics of creating graphs in GGPlot and later on we will go over how to do more specialized things. This is by no means a complete guide to GGPlot but will do most of the things that you will need to do in GGPlot. Any suggestions or recommendtions of things to add would be welcome.    


## Load Libraries    
```{r}
# load the libraries each time you restart R
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(readxl)
library(scales)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(patchwork)
```


## Read in the file
```{r 03_read_data}
# Read in file using tidyverse code-----
south.df <- read_csv("data/South_Lake.csv", guess_max = 1000)
```


#### Read in excel files
Note that you can read in excel files in the same way.
```{r}
# Note you can read in excel files just as easy
south_excel.df <- read_excel("data/south_lake.xlsx", sheet = "south_lake")
```


## Look at datafram structure    
One way is to click the blue trianlge in the environment tab in the upper right     
You can also use code to inspect the structure of the dataset
```{r}
# data Structure
str(south.df)
# or
glimpse(south.df)
```


## Saving files     
Before we go too far it is often important to save the modified data    
We can use the read_r pacakage to do this with write_csv
```{r}
# Saving files -----
# We can save the file we just read in using 
# Saving dataframes -----
# lets say you have made a lot of changes and its now time to save the dataframe
write_csv(south.df, "finalized_data/output_file.csv")
```




## Graphing data 
I feel that graphing is the key to all data analysis. If you can look at your data you can begin to see patterns that you may have predicted and want to test statistically. You will also be able to see outliers that exist that might affect resutls faster than looking at summary statistics.     
     
Using proper GGPlot code you are supposed to have  data=, y= and x= ....      
I have found that these are not necessary most of the time unless you put y= in differnet geom statements.       
```{r}
# GGplot layering ----
# GGplot uses layers to build a graph
ggplot(data=south.df, aes(x=date, y=cladoceran)) + # this sets up data 
  geom_line() # this adds a geometry to present the data from above
```


Because GGPlot buidls things in layers you can add other geoms to the plot. Below you should try this code and see what happens when you put in a + after geom_line() and then add `gome_point()`.    
```{r}
# Add geom_point() -----
# Add points to the graph below using geom_point()
ggplot(south.df, aes(x=date, y=cladoceran)) +
  geom_line() 	

```

 
## Adding axes labels    
You can add in simple axes labels that are not fromatted. Using the labs(x= " ", y = " ") statement.  You can add in line breaks by putting in a `\n`  in the statement that you have below.    

```{r}
# Adding axes labels ----
ggplot(south.df, aes(x=date, y=cladoceran)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Animals (Number per Liter)")

```


## Formatted axes labels      
What I find really nice is being able to create formatted axes labels. You can do this a few ways but I have found the that the expression statement works the best for my needs. You can add in a `~` to add a space between symbols and a `*` will connect things without a space.    
```{r}
# Label expressions -----
# Adding special formatting to labels
ggplot(south.df, aes(x=date, y=cladoceran)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Date", y = expression(bold("Animals (No. L"^-1*")")))

```


## Dates as the X Axis    
This can be an issue for a lot of research and is often the most difficult 
thing to deal with.  This is where the scales pacakge comes into its own.
```{r}
# Dates on the X-Axis -----
# So now you might want to change the axes scales
# uses the scales pacakges
ggplot(south.df, aes(x=date, y=cladoceran)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Date", y = expression(bold("Animals (No. L"^-1*")"))) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "6 month",
           # limits = as_datetime(c('2017-06-01 00:00:00','2017-08-01 00:00:00')),
        labels=date_format("%Y-%m-%d"), expand=c(0,0))
```

The key for formatting axes with dates and times using the following abbreviations
CODE	  MEANING
  %y	    year, without century (00-99)        
  %Y	    year, with century (0000-9999)        
        
  %m	    month, numeric (01-12)        
  %b	    month, abbreviated (Jan-Dec)        
  %B	    month, full (January-December)        
        
  %a	    day of the week, abbreviated (Mon-Sun)        
  %A	    day of the week, full (Monday-Sunday)        
  %e	    day of the month (1-31)        
  %d	    day of the month (01-31)        
  
  %l	    hour, in 12-hour clock (1-12)        
  %I	    hour, in 12-hour clock (01-12)        
  %H	    hour, in 24-hour clock (01-24        
        
  %M	    minute (00-59)        
          
  %S	    second (00-59)        



## Modifying themes     
The appearance of graphs is modified using theme statements

```{r}
# Themes for graphs -----
# Here we need to start setting the theme for the graph or appearance
# There are built in theme 
ggplot(south.df, aes(x=date, y=cladoceran)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Date", y = expression(bold("Animals (No. L"^-1*")"))) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "6 month",
          # limits = as_datetime(c('2017-06-01 00:00:00','2017-08-01 00:00:00')),
         labels=date_format("%Y-%m-%d"), expand=c(0,0)) +
  theme_light()
```


you can try a lot of other themes    
theme_gray      
theme_bw      
theme_linedraw    
theme_light     
theme_dark     
theme_minimal    
theme_classic      
theme_void     
theme_test      
     
```{r}
# NOW - try a few different themes
ggplot(south.df, aes(x=date, y=cladoceran)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Date", y = expression(bold("Animals (No. L"^-1*")"))) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "6 month",
       # limits = as_datetime(c('2017-06-01 00:00:00','2017-08-01 00:00:00')),
        labels=date_format("%Y-%m-%d"), expand=c(0,0))

```

## Adusting themes
You can manually adjust theme components

```{r}

# Adjusting graph themes ----
# so now there is a formatted axis but we need to change the rotation of the font
ggplot(south.df, aes(x=date, y=cladoceran)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Date", y = expression(bold("Animals (No. L"^-1*")"))) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "6 month",
      limits = as_date(c('1994-06-01', '2006-12-31')),
      labels=date_format("%Y-%m-%d"), expand=c(0,0)) + 
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(size=12, face="bold", angle=45, hjust=1)
    )
```


## GGThemeAssistant 
So you could as Dr. Google every theme aspect and spend hours making grpahs
Use ggtheme assistant - highlight code of graph and go to Addins    
Select ggplot Theme Assistant     

This will open a dialog box and then the code will appear below   
It may not work in the markdown format though... only script files    

```{r}
ggplot(south.df, aes(x=date, y=cladoceran)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Date", y = expression(bold("Animals (No. L"^-1*")"))) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "6 month",
               limits = as_date(c('1994-06-01', '2006-12-31')),
               labels=date_format("%Y-%m-%d"), expand=c(0,0))
```


## Common Theme Statments      
This is a list or statement that I use for a lot of my graphs    
```{r}
# Commonly used theme settings ------
# This is the set of theme settings I use

ggplot(south.df, aes(x=date, y=cladoceran)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Date", y = expression(bold("Animals (No. L"^-1*")"))) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "6 month",
               limits = as_date(c('1994-06-01', '2006-12-31')),
               labels=date_format("%Y-%m-%d"), expand=c(0,0))+
  theme(
    # LABLES APPEARANCE
    axis.title.x=element_text(size=14, face="bold"),
    axis.title.y=element_text(size=14, face="bold"),
    axis.text.x = element_text(size=14, face="bold", angle=45, hjust=1),
    axis.text.y = element_text(size=14, face="bold"),
    # plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, colour="black", size=22, face="bold"),
    # LEGEND
    legend.position="none",
    # LEGEND TEXT
    legend.text = element_text(colour="black", size = 14, face = "bold"),
    # LEGEND TITLE
    legend.title = element_text(colour="black", size=16, face="bold"),
    # LEGEND POSITION AND JUSTIFICATION 
    # legend.justification=c(0.1,1),
    # legend.position=c(0.02,.99),
    # REMOVE LEGEND BOX
    # legend.key = element_rect(fill = "transparent", colour = "transparent"), 
    # REMOVE LEGEND BOX
    # legend.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent", colour = "transparent"), 
    # #REMOVE PLOT FILL AND GRIDS
    # panel.background=element_rect(fill = "transparent", colour = "transparent"), 
    # # removes the window background
    # plot.background=element_rect(fill="transparent",colour=NA),
    # # removes the grid lines
    # panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
    # panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    # ADD AXES LINES AND SIZE
    axis.line.x = element_line(color="black", size = 0.3),
    axis.line.y = element_line(color="black", size = 0.3),
    # ADD PLOT BOX
    panel.border = element_rect(colour = "black", fill=NA, size=0.3))

```

## Creating custom theme    
You can also make your own theme to avoid this every time
Theme for Graphs
Make a new default theme
```{r}
# Run this and it will store it as an object for use later
theme_gleon <- function(base_size = 14, base_family = "Times")
{
  theme(
    # LABLES APPEARANCE
    axis.title.x=element_text(size=14, face="bold"),
    axis.title.y=element_text(size=14, face="bold"),
    axis.text.x = element_text(size=14, face="bold", angle=45, hjust=1),
    axis.text.y = element_text(size=14, face="bold"),
    # plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, colour="black", size=22, face="bold"),
    # LEGEND
    legend.position="none",
    # LEGEND TEXT
    legend.text = element_text(colour="black", size = 14, face = "bold"),
    # LEGEND TITLE
    legend.title = element_text(colour="black", size=16, face="bold"),
    # LEGEND POSITION AND JUSTIFICATION 
    # legend.justification=c(0.1,1),
    # legend.position=c(0.02,.99),
    # REMOVE LEGEND BOX
    # legend.key = element_rect(fill = "transparent", colour = "transparent"), 
    # REMOVE LEGEND BOX
    # legend.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent", colour = "transparent"), 
    # #REMOVE PLOT FILL AND GRIDS
    # panel.background=element_rect(fill = "transparent", colour = "transparent"), 
    # # removes the window background
    # plot.background=element_rect(fill="transparent",colour=NA),
    # # removes the grid lines
    # panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
    # panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    # ADD AXES LINES AND SIZE
    axis.line.x = element_line(color="black", size = 0.3),
    axis.line.y = element_line(color="black", size = 0.3),
    # ADD PLOT BOX
    panel.border = element_rect(colour = "black", fill=NA, size=0.3))
  }
```


## Using custom theme   
This is how you use your own theme   
```{r}
# using the new theme
ggplot(south.df, aes(x=date, y=cladoceran)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Date", y = expression(bold("Animals (No. L"^-1*")"))) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "6 month",
               limits = as_date(c('1994-06-01', '2006-12-31')),
               labels=date_format("%Y-%m-%d"), expand=c(0,0)) +
  theme_gleon()
```


# Saving last plot     
This is how you would save the last plot   
```{r}
# say this is all you wanted for your advisor and you wanted to save it...
# manual point click method is to use export --> pdf or image
# the code method to save the last plot made is ---
ggsave(last_plot(), 
       file="figures/plot1.pdf",
       width = 10, height = 8, 
       units="in",
       dpi=300)
```


## Saving named plots    
You can save plots as an object and then call it back or use the name to save it    
```{r}
# Saving named plots-----
# you can also save the plot and save by name----
plot1.plot <-  ggplot(south.df, aes(x=date, y=cladoceran)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() 
plot1.plot

ggsave(plot1.plot, 
       file="figures/plot1.pdf",
       width = 10, height = 8, 
       units="in",
       dpi=300)
```


# Further cusomizations     
## Shapes of Points     
We could also map the type of point shape to the species   
```{r}
ggplot(south.df, aes(x=date, y=cladoceran)) +
  geom_point(size=4, shape=6)
```

The shapes of the various options are:   
![Shapes of various points.](images/point_shapes.png)
```{r}
ggplot(south.df, aes(x=date, y=cladoceran)) +
  geom_point(size=4, shape=6) +
  geom_line( linetype ="longdash")
```

The types of lines you can have are:
