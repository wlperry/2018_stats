## R and Tidyverse      

I am in the process of developing a website and course for both undergraduates and graduate students for cleaning and analysis of data. Many of the examples here will be focussed on aquatic sciences or environmental monitoring data. I have found graphing the data first and then working to clean the data along the lines of "[R for Data Science](HTTP://r4ds.had.co.nz/)" by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham to be one of the greatest approaches.  
     
This is also a selfish way to organize my code and snippets in a central place that I can find them and make is available to others that are struggling with R and dataframes.      
       
### This file has links to many of the example dataframes that I will use.      
[Example data](example_data.html)     


## [1. Basics of projects and data](01_intro.html)     
Before working on a project, I have found it is useful to ponder what the data will look like, what you want the final dataframe to look like and what you want to do with it. So, first we will go over basics of organization.  
     - folders and structure    
     - file formats    
     - file structure     
     - output formats   
     - installing R and R studio
     - basics of the R interface
     - R projects
     - installing libraries       
       
## [2. Libraries](02_libraries.html)    
The first thing to do is to load libraries and this is the start of how to do that.

## [3. Reading files and GGPLOT](03_ggplot.html)     
Introduction into reading in excel and csv files and then how to visualize the data using GGPlot2 / GGPlot. In this page, I go over how to load libraries and start to graph with GGplot. Understanding the basics is key and then I go from there. This file includes topics like:    
     - read in csv file    
     - simple graphs  
     - geometries   
     - colors and mapping   
     - layers 

## [4. GGPLOT stats plots](04_ggplot_stats.html)    
This will introduce you to the basic data exploratory graphs and statistics in graphs that will make life a lot easier
      - box and whisker plot
      - histograms
      - mean and standard error plots
      - time series plots
    
## [5. Dataframe modification](05_data_modification.html)    
This will show you how to modify the dataframe.   

## [6. Dataframe wide to long](06_dataframe_widelong.html)    
This will show you how to modify the dataframe from wide to long and back. Also it has how to spread and unite values... 

## [7. Correlation and Regression](07_correlation_regression.html)  
Correlations and Regressions. More to come but code is done.    

## [8. T Tests](08_ttests.html)  
T tests....

## [9. One way ANOVA](09_oneway_anova.html)  
One way anovas  

## [10. Two way ANOVA](10_twoway_anovas.html)  
One way anovas  

## [11. ANCOVA](11_ancova.html)  
Ancova and the fun and joy of interactions
