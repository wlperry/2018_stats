##R Blog using Tidyverse to exmine data using both internal dataframes and stream and lake specific data.   

I am going to try to develo an introductory class specifically for aquatic biologists using streaming data, larger time based dataframes, but also data that is more traditional. I will be first following the approach of "[R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)" by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.  
  
<br>   

This is also a selfish way to organize my code and snippets in a central place that I can find them and make is avaialbe to others that are struggling with R and dataframes.     
<br>

##[Basics of datascience and organizing projects](01_intro.html)     
Before working on a project, I have found it is useful to ponder what the data will look like, what you want the final dataframe to look like and what you want to do with it. So, first we will go over basics of organization.  
     - folders and structure    
     - file formats    
     - file structure     
     - output formats   
     - installing R and R studio
     - basics of the R interface
     - R projects
     - installing libraries       

<br>

##[Reading in files and GGPLOT](01_ggplot.html)     
This will be the introduction into reading in excel and csv files and then how to visualize the data using GGPlot2 or GGPlot.     In this page, I go over how to load libraries and start to graph with GGplot. Understanding the basics is key and then I go from there. This file includes topics like:    
     - install and load libraries    
     - read in csv file    
     -  xy graphs   
     - varaible versus time graphs    
     - working with time on axes   
     - modifiying graphical appearnance with theme settings
