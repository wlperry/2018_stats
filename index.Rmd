##R and Tidyverse      

I am going to try to develop an introductory class specifically for aquatic biologists using streaming data, larger time based dataframes, but also data that is more traditional. I will be first following the approach of "[R for Data Science](HTTP://r4ds.had.co.nz/)" by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.  
  
<br>   

This is also a selfish way to organize my code and snippets in a central place that I can find them and make is available to others that are struggling with R and dataframes.     
<br>

##[Basics of datascience and organizing projects](01_intro.html)     
Before working on a project, I have found it is useful to ponder what the data will look like, what you want the final dataframe to look like and what you want to do with it. So, first we will go over basics of organization.  
     - folders and structure    
     - file formats    
     - file structure     
     - output formats   
     - installing R and R studio
     - basics of the R interface
     - R projects
     - installing libraries

##[Reading in files and GGPLOT intro](02_ggplot.html)     
This will be the introduction into reading in excel and csv files and then how to visualize the data using GGPlot2 or GGPlot. In this page, I go over how to load libraries and start to graph with GGplot. Understanding the basics is key and then I go from there. This file includes topics like:    
     - read in csv file    
     - simple graphs  
     - geometries   
     - colors and mapping   
     - layers 

##[GGPLOT intermediate plots and stats](03_ggplot_stats.html)    
This will introduce you to the basic data exploratory graphs and statistics in graphs that will make life a lot easier
      - box and whisker plot
      - histograms
      - mean and standard error plots
      - time series plots
    
##[Dataframe modification](04_data_modification.html)    
This will show you how to modify the dataframe.   

##[Dataframe wide to long](05_dataframe_widelong.html)    
This will show you how to modify the dataframe from wide to long and back. Also it has how to spread and unite values... 

##[Correlation and Regression](06_dcorrelation_regression.html)    
Correlations and Regressions. More to come but code is done.
